            <h2>Bird in Flight</h2>
            Hello, friend. I don't know what i have to say, maybe "Welcome to my personal page!" or something else. But, i think it will be better if i ask you, Do you like your life? What are you doing here? What are you looking for? You know, sometimes you need to change everything in your life. If you want to know, whenever i ask any person about his life and what he wants to do, i never get a specific answer, maybe you are the same person? You go with the flow, your life is shit, maybe it's time to do something about it? Look, your life is getting shorter by the minute, quit your job, take something and perfect it, stop being a piece of shit.

            If you want to become a really successful specialist in some direction and you know what you need to do, in this case, all you have to do is just act, obvious, right? It's not so difficult if you are determined and know why you live, let you start looking for some ways and possibilities how to implement it. Use how-to stuff and other documentation, youtube and speak with people who know how to do it. You know, success is not money, not always money. I think will be better, if you create something amazing, that you dream about. I will talk in the context of IT. Okay, you have decided to become a professional hacker it does not matter which one, black hat, or white, maybe just IT specialist. Only what i can say for you and maybe give some advice, if you are new to this, don't try to achieve something to certain age, because sometimes life is unpredictable, and when you try to do something and it does not work as you expected, it's okay, that's how it should be, those who don't give up win. You won't become a professional specialist in 1 month, year, in that fact. You need to study very a lot, take something and bring it to perfection. I know no so many guys, who spent a lot of time and achieved what they wanted, they have spent many years in order to achieve what they dream of.
            Prioritize, choose your life purpose and go! When you can't do something, and you don't know how to resolve a problem, use youtube and google, you need to become more self sufficient, study how to resolve any problem in your own! You have to know a lot if we are talking about hacking, if you want to get into the elite, it depends on your ambition, but you don't have to be there to enjoy it. Just love what you do, and strive become better then you was yesterday, it's life style, study a lot, and feel life. Your inner peace is connected with the realization of your desires. No one took the path to professional programming or hacking easily, everyone who i know is learning a lot and everyone has faced challenges that require you to be more patient and overcome them. When something wrong and they did not know what to do, they start reading more and more, they are looking for how to solve it, and again try to do it. And again, again, until they get it. This is refers to life in general. You meet a problem, and don't go ahead until you don't solve it. Be in the crowd, refuse honors. Just observe how everything works, become a smarter that you was yesterday. Don't be like everyone else, be smarter and know what you want to achieve! But, if you don't believe in yourself and are convinced you won't, accept your fate. You can choose and office job, bake pies and cakes, and watch life pass you by.
