                Hello, friend, i don't know what you'll see useful for you, maybe something what will help you, maybe not, i don't care about it. I want to tell you a little about this site. I've not published in .onion space because i won't publish here illegal how-to-stuff and other illegal elements. Which may encourage you to break the law and harm someone. I agree,  information should be free for everyone who wants to improve their lives and maybe create something. Something amazing. But often it doesn't happen. Most often, many people go on their egos and commit crimes. i want to say, don't do this, choose another way to earn money and don't neglect your own freedom. Don't listen fucking idiots who don't believe in themselves, and who don't believe in their abilities. And who always chooses shortcuts.

            This site is new, and i when i start writing it, i didn't have specific goal, for what. I'll publish here some topics, which might be interested in. I'll search and write about : philosophy, hacking guides, anonymity, and something else. I hope that it'll help you. But i'm not sure. Definitely if you want to find what you want, you'll get it. Real hackers and good programmers don't look information in open sources, maybe foundamental knowledges about something. And I think this is the first step forward. Start search information, and be interested in something and strive for something. Select keywords and start searching, read, read and read! Use google and youtube, don't waste your time because we don't have much of it. You need to become more self-sufficient and solve any problem in your own. If you'll keep digging you find what you are looking for.

            I wrote this site with PHP, clean PHP without frameworks. I wrote this site using the concepts of object-oriented programming, i can list the patterns that helped me implement it.  with MySQL and HTML/CSS, as you can see, i don't care about looks, i focus only backend-side. You can check my code on  i tried to implement all backend related functions.
