                            Hello, my dear friends, the main topic here will about anonymity, i think it's the most important thing that we can do in modern life, because i can't imagine how we can live without our personal area when everyone can sees how we live.
                            I'll find any useful information for you, what can improve your knowledges in the hidden side.

                        Of course, i wrote this site when i have free time and try to share with you some knowledges and links, some resources which will useful to you. I consider this like a hobby.

                        I'm focused only backend, not about frontend, and that's the main reason why this site doesn't have a good design. And just i want'to train my skills in backend too. And i thought that maybe i can create something, like a simple blog or regular information resource. And I'll be reading a lot of information about anonymity and TCP/IP and how the internet works in general. Because i care about what i don't know, frequently when you start learn something more deeply, you begin to realize how little you know. It's okay.

                        As i said, it's not necessary login/register, it's just a train for backend side, and you can just read some topics, maybe you'll find something what you need. And for now, when i've finished backend i can focus on website content. start searching and reading as much as I can, maybe later i can think of something better.

                Â© 2022 a non-commercial website with no specific purpose and maybe I can come up with something better than the simple code in the background but like I said I don't like the front-end and prefer the back-end and I think that's what we live for to do what we like, because it's your life and you have to choose your own path.
