                            Hello, my dear friends, the main topic here will about anonymity, i think it's the most important thing that we can do in modern life, because i can't imagine how we can live without our personal area when everyone can sees how we live.
                            I'll find any useful information for you, what can improve your knowledges in the hidden side.

                    <br>
                    <span class="about_desc">
                        Of course, i wrote this site when i have free time and try to share with you some knowledges and links, some resources which will useful to you. I consider this like a hobby.

                    <span class="about_desc">
                        I'm focused only backend, not about frontend, and that's the main reason why this site doesn't have a good design. And just i want'to train my skills in backend too. And i thought that maybe i can create something, like a simple blog or regular information resource. And I'll be reading a lot of information about anonymity and TCP/IP and how the internet works in general. Because i care about what i don't know, frequently when you start learn something more deeply, you begin to realize how little you know. It's okay.

                        As i said, it's not necessary login/register, it's just a train for backend side, and you can just read some topics, maybe you'll find something what you need. And for now, when i've finished backend i can focus on website content. start searching and reading as much as I can, maybe later i can think of something better.

                        You can contact me, and maybe suggest something better. And also you can use these link first, and use this keywords to dig more deeper and read anything you don't understand.

                                I prefer to contact in Telegram, if you have any questions and something else just text me. Email and PGP is not necessary. If you are programmer, and you have checked my code and you can give me some advice on how i can make it better, I'll listen to you with pleasure. Please feel free and contact me.
