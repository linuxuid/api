                        I specialize in backend development and i have only 1+ year experience, i am very young, i really enjoy with this activity, i can work very hard and have fun, just relax and write code, solve issues, and create what's in your head, like an artist, who paints with a brush and depicts what's in his mind. I've always tried to figure things out on my own, because you need to be more self-sufficient. And i am inspired by success other hackers and programmers who can do things that other people can't. It's amazing, and i would like to be like them. Your dreams...

                        I convinced that if you believe in yourself and you keep striving to your dreams - you'll realize it. Often when I ask someone about their dreams and what they want out of life, I never get a specific answer. It scares me sometimes when a person doesn't not even try to do anythig to change what's happening. To go with the flow like a piece of shit. Accept fate and die with unfulfilled plans. When you don't even try to work on yourself, on your inner world, when you think that some things will make you happy, whatching how life passes by. I believe that this world is driven by dreams.
